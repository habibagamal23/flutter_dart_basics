A repository containing basic Dart and Flutter examples, including various data types and their usage.


# I  added examples of various data types and their usage in Dart. Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll find:

- Strings: Simple text handling.
- Integers: Whole numbers.
- Doubles: Floating-point numbers.
- Booleans: True/false values.
- Lists: Ordered collections.
- Maps: Key-value pairs.
- Sets: Unique collections.
- Late Variables: For lazy initialization.
- Var: Declare variables without explicitly specifying their type.
