A repository containing basic Dart and Flutter examples, including various data types and their usage.


# I  added examples of various data types and their usage in Dart. Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll find:

- Strings: Simple text handling.
- Integers: Whole numbers.
- Doubles: Floating-point numbers.
- Booleans: True/false values.
- Lists: Ordered collections.
- Maps: Key-value pairs.
- Sets: Unique collections.
- Late Variables: For lazy initialization.
- Var: Declare variables without explicitly specifying their type.

# Dart Condition Statements: `if-else` and `switch`


## Key Points

### `if` Statement

- Used to test a condition.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, and there's an `else` block, the code inside the `else` block is executed instead.

### `if-case` Statement

- A specific form of `if` to handle particular cases.

### `switch` Statement

- Ideal for comparing a single variable against multiple constant values.
- Provides more readable and maintainable code for discrete values.
