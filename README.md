A repository containing basic Dart and Flutter examples, including various data types and their usage.


# I  added examples of various data types and their usage in Dart. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what you‚Äôll find:

- Strings: Simple text handling.
- Integers: Whole numbers.
- Doubles: Floating-point numbers.
- Booleans: True/false values.
- Lists: Ordered collections.
- Maps: Key-value pairs.
- Sets: Unique collections.
- Late Variables: For lazy initialization.
- Var: Declare variables without explicitly specifying their type.

# Dart Condition Statements: `if-else` and `switch`


## Key Points

### `if` Statement

- Used to test a condition.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, and there's an `else` block, the code inside the `else` block is executed instead.

### `if-case` Statement

- A specific form of `if` to handle particular cases.

### `switch` Statement

- Ideal for comparing a single variable against multiple constant values.
- Provides more readable and maintainable code for discrete values.


# Understanding Methods and Parameters
### üõ†Ô∏è Types of Methods:
Void Method: Does not return a value, performs an action.
Return Method: Returns a value of a specified data type (e.g., int, String).
### üìå Understanding Parameters and Arguments:
Argument: The value passed when calling a method.
Parameter: The variable in the method that receives the passed value.
### üîç Types of Parameters:
Normal Parameter: Must be provided when the method is called.
Optional Parameter: Not mandatory, can have a default value, enclosed in square brackets.
Named Parameter: Optional, must be specified by name when calling, enclosed in curly brackets.
### üí° Tips:
Optional Parameters should always be last.
Every named parameter is optional, but not all optional parameters are named.
